Features
==================

- add new entries scanned from metadata: year, actors, director, (short/long) description, author, rating, studio
- add support for tv series / shows with metadata: air date, studio, actors, season, episode, episode title
- improve UPNP reply types for video mime-type for director, album art, episodes
- present metadata for folders to support virtual tv show folders and tv seasons
- add option to ignore certain paths from scanning
- add possibility to serve multiple-sized thumbnails based on client request
- support additional video containers like 'Tv Shows' and 'Movies' if metadata is available
- support scanning multiple captions for a media (use language suffix .ENG, .HUN, etc.)
  note: until there is a UI to support selection, only default caption will be returned which
  is either the one without language, or the first one if there is no language
- support ignoring wildcard files/folders during scanning
- support specifying ignore and albumart wildcards over multiple entries in the config
- icons are read from data folder instead of compiled into binary
- add periodic non-destructive rescan which detects removed and added media even if inotify is not working
